FEATURE DESCRIPTORS

Feature descriptors are derived from MIP/MIG database.
Possible geometries seem off at times.
We apply some 'heuristics' in determining the 'one geometry' to use per feature.

A)  If milsymbols recognizes a given SIDC the geometry is assumed to be POINT.
B)  If geometries contains a single geoemtry, it should be a safe game.
B1) All orbit (5)/fan (12) areas are single geometry entries.
C)  For two or more geometries, things more or less undefined.

NOTE:  Ellipses are excluded. They seem special cases of polygons.
