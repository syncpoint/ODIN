# ODIN - C2IS (Open Source)

[![Build Status: Linux](https://travis-ci.org/syncpoint/ODIN.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/syncpoint/ODIN.svg?branch=develop)

While currently in its early infancy, ODIN aims to become an Open Source alternative to industry-led commercial Command and Control Information Systems. Our main goal is __simplicity__. Coming from a military background, we think it's time for a paradigm shift. Together with a vibrant community, we want to lead the way towards lightweight and user-friendly systems.
