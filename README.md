# ODIN - C2IS (Open Source)

While currently in its early infancy, ODIN wants to become an Open Source alternative to industry-led commercial Command and Control Information Systems. Our main goal is __simplicity__. Coming from a military background, we think it's time for a paradigm shift. Together with a vibrant community, we want to lead the way towards lightweight and user-friendly systems.

## Contributing
If you are interested in raising ODIN to become big and strong, there are several ways you can help: Feature request, bugs and other backlog items can be reported in the [issues section](https://github.com/syncpoint/ODIN/issues) of the repository. Pull requests are also highly appreciated. And finally, any form of testing and feedback is welcome.

Please also see our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
